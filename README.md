#VUE.JS COURSE - CODERHOUSE 

# Final Project

Web App for a restaurant. What you'll find here are the products the restaurant sells and the locations of the buildings.
You'll also be able to purchase some products.

I used <https://mockapi.io/> for the backend.

### Core Concepts
Here there are some of the core concepts that you ll learn if you want to work with this code!

* Bootstrap CSS Library.
* Vuex.
* Vue Router.
* HTTP Requests using AXIOS.
* Login and Authentication (small and easy, no security)
* How to deploy a project.
* Using Firebase for Deploying the project.


## Getting Started

### Cloning the Project:

git clone <https://github.com/delvalj/ProyectoFinal-DelVal.git>

## Installing

###  How to Install it

Open the terminal and run:

- npm install

## Starting

### Open the project in LocalHost:

In the terminal:

- npm run serve

## Deployment
https://trabajo-final-coder.web.app/

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

In order to deploy the project i used the Firesbase Hosting option.
In your local console in Firebase you have the option HOSTING. Go for it.

After that you'll have to install some things to make it work...

- npm run build

After you are done with these you'll find a new directory called DIST. This is the project with all the optimization needed for firebase.

Then, following Firebase instructions

- npm install -g firebase-tools
- firebase login
- firebase init
- firebase deploy
